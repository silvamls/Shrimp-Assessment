# Shrimp-Assessment

This repository contains the full analytical framework, code, and outputs developed for the catch-based stock assessment of Brazilian penaeid shrimp fisheries. The study integrates reconstructed catch time series, CMSY++ modeling, neural-network–assisted depletion priors, and short-term catch projections to estimate stock status and Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) reference points for major shrimp species (pink, white, and seabob) across Brazil’s coastal regions.

All scripts used in data processing, reconstruction handling, prior generation, model fitting, and projection analyses are provided. The repository also includes the final result spreadsheets, diagnostic tables, and all figures produced throughout the assessment.
